// This is a basic Flutter widget test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

    // Due to the async nature of Firebase initialization and initial auth state loading,
    // we might need to pump a few times or use pumpAndSettle.
    // For this basic test, we'll assume the LoginScreen shows up first if no user.
    // Or, if a user is mocked/logged in, it might go to HomeScreen.
    // The original test looked for '0' and '1' which suggests a counter.
    // This app structure is different. Let's verify something basic from LoginScreen or HomeScreen.

    // If LoginScreen is expected (no user by default in GameProvider mock or fresh state)
    await tester.pumpAndSettle(); // Wait for UI to stabilize

    // Check if LoginScreen elements are present
    // This is a placeholder. Actual test would depend on GameProvider's initial state.
    // For now, let's assume we get to a state where a MaterialApp is built.
    expect(find.byType(MaterialApp), findsOneWidget);

    // The original test was for a counter app, this app is different.
    // This test needs to be adapted to the new app's functionality.
    // For now, a smoke test that the app builds is sufficient.
    // Example: Verify "TASK DOMINION" text from LoginScreen or HeaderWidget appears.
    // As GameProvider might show a loading spinner first, then LoginScreen.
    // final loginTitle = find.text('TASK DOMINION');
    // expect(loginTitle, findsOneWidget); // This might fail depending on initial loading state.
